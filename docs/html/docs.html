<p>Statechart based distributed systems do not stay put.</p>
<p>The statechart abstraction is very powerful for translating a set of
technological goals into pictures, then into robust, working software.  So as
you change your designs, you won’t have to spend a lot of time updating your
statechart diagrams.</p>
<p>Not everyone understands how to read a statechart diagram, or a set of them
working together to describe a distributed system.  A statechart diagram can
describe all of the features working together at once.  This is a bit much, even
if you do know how to read them.  So to explain a feature you will have to
translate it into another set of diagrams; which in turn, will have to be
explained with words.</p>
<p>But the smallest change in the design could wipe out pages and pages of this
carefully written documentation.  It might not be worth your time to write
everything down.</p>
<p>I’ll explore this idea using a topographical map as an analogy.  A topographical
map describes the landscape from a bird’s eye view, where each contour line is
drawn at a specific elevation.  It was invented by the British mathematician,
Charles Hutton in 1774.  This was a huge innovation that not a lot of people
know about.</p>
<p>To see what this landscape would look like while on the ground, you would need
to make a topographical projection.  To simplify our language a bit – we will
call a topographical projection a projection.</p>
<p>The diagram below <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id4" id="id1">1</a> demonstrates how to map a projection from a topographical
map.  In the bottom box of the picture, we see a topographical map of a volcano.
In the top box we see it’s projection, or what it would look like while walking
toward it from the south:</p>
<img alt="_images/topographical_projection.gif" class="scale-to-fit" src="_images/topographical_projection.gif" />
<p>If you were to approach this same mountain from the west instead, you would need
to make a new projection.   In fact, you could make many many different
projections of this one diagram, each describing a different directional
approach to the same volcano.</p>
<p>Your statechart diagram is like a topographical map.</p>
<p>Both the statechart and a topographical map contain many many different stories
and approaches.  A specific feature of your statechart program is like a vantage
point from the ground to our topographical map.</p>
<p>To see how a specific feature works, you could send it’s events to the
instrumented software representing your statechart.  Then you could use the
output of this instrumentation to make another picture, a sequence diagram.</p>
<p>A sequence diagram is easy to understand, it is immediately intuitive; just like
a projection.  A projection is to a topographical map as a sequence diagram is
to a statechart.</p>
<img alt="_images/volcano_exploding.jpg" class="scale-to-fit" src="_images/volcano_exploding.jpg" />
<p>The volcano explodes <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id5" id="id2">2</a>.  It has a new shape, which we have bravely surveyed
so that we can re-draw our topographical map.  But now every one of our
meticulously derived projections needs to be re-drawn too, because every visual
approach to the volcano will look different than it did before.  Likewise, if
you make a slight adjustment to your statechart, all of the sequence diagrams
and their writings need to be re-drawn and re-written.</p>
<p>Let’s think about the utility of the projection.  Anyone can understand it
because this is what you see when you are walking around on the ground, it is
based on innate cognition.</p>
<p>But the topographical map isn’t like the projection.  It is something that is
more abstract, like an analog clock – a child doesn’t implicitly know how to
use it; how it models the world needs to be taught.  It is a proud moment when
you can give a child an analog watch.  Once such an abstraction is understood it
becomes immensely useful – because it packs a lot of information about the world
into a small space.</p>
<p>A sequence diagram can be immediately understood like a projection or a digital
watch face.  We implicitly understand stories and time.  This is what a sequence
diagram draws on the page.</p>
<p>But the engineering features for a complex system are always changing.  To
relate this back to the map analogy, our volcanos frequently explode, re-grow
and blow up again.  In such situations, it is crucial to re-draw the
topographical map representing the territory.  This won’t take a lot of time,
since the abstraction provided by statecharts makes it easy to map
specifications into pictures.</p>
<p>But are you going to teach the person in marketing how to read a statechart?
Good luck with that.  That doesn’t mean that it isn’t your responsibility to
explain things in a way that she can understand them.  She needs to know how the
system works so that she can do her job.  So you use what she already knows:
how to understand stories.  You can provide her with a set of sequence diagrams
describing how their story changes over time.</p>
<p>The sequence diagrams are just projections of a statechart.  They are generative.</p>
<p>I wrote the sequence tool to <a class="reference external" href="https://aleph2c.github.io/miros/recipes.html#drawing-a-sequence-diagram">draw your sequence diagrams for you</a>.  It
takes trace instrumentation from multiple nodes and renders it into ASCII
sequence diagrams so that they can be dropped into the code as comments, or
written into markdown, sphinx, or where ever you put your information.  Instead
of spending time drawing a custom sequence diagram, you select your trace
instrumentation and let the tool draw a picture for you.</p>
<p>This means that you have to write working code before you can document it with words.
If you are like me, your first map will be wrong and your code’s behavior as seen
through it’s instrumentation will show you where you have made mistakes.  Once you have
iterated a few times, your map will be closer to what you intended to build and you will
have some useful multi-node trace information that you can use to draw a sequence
diagram for you.</p>
<p>Here is a video of some capture trace instrumentation being turned into a sequence
diagram describing a distributed interaction:</p>
<div class="video-content">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GQRh5Bd91O8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div><p>The sequence tool does not understand your design; you will have to add your
information to the picture by numbering the event signal names.  Under this
numbered diagram, you can write what each number signifies and describe how the
various node interactions work.  These sequence diagrams quickly become very big
and unwieldy.  They will not be able to explain everything, and they don’t have
to.  Your Harel Statechart pictures capture your system specification.</p>
<p>The Harel statechart picture, the sequence diagram and the class diagrams used
by this framework are just a few of the different picture types described by
UML.  But what is UML anyway?</p>
<p>It’s just a collection of standards about how to draw some pictures of object
oriented software systems.</p>
<p>UML has a PR problem, and it was probably the UML class diagrams that did the
most to harm the UML brand.  They emphasize classes over objects, and they are
fragile in the face of design changes.</p>
<p>But, these class diagrams can provide some useful pictures.  In the context of
this library they are useful for describing how you have adjusted a base
NetworkedFactory or NetworkedActiveObject class to match your specific design
specification.</p>
<p>The UML class diagram has a myriad of different arrows that are used differently
in different situations.  UML is needlessly confusing, and it probably resulted
from people wanting to turn UML into a programming language on it’s own.  They
should have left it as a collection of guidelines for sketching out some
pictures that can be understood by other people.</p>
<p>Nobody really understands UML; UML has contradictions in its specification.  If
it were understood, its authors would have removed the inconsistencies before it
was released.  So don’t worry about being entirely faithful to UML as a formal
system; you can’t, it is impossible.  You have a programming language already:
Python. UML can’t even come close to describing what Python can do, so you don’t
need to program with UML, just use its diagram recommendations as sketches.
Ensure that new team members understand what your pictures mean; don’t build a
priesthood.</p>
<p>You will be fighting your drawing tools (unless you use Miro Samek’s c/C++
framework).  Since UML became undead, not a lot of work has been put into
writing drawing packages that will let you make UML sketches.  But there are
still some free tools you can use to avoid Vendor lock-in.  I use UMLet.  It
allows you to build your own templates, based on theirs and you can use it on
all operating systems because UMLet is written in Java.  It’s fast and ugly, so
you don’t fall in love with your pictures.  It has a command line interface that
can be used to export its drawings into SVG and PDF formats; it is easy to
automate.</p>
<p>Keep your internal pictures ugly – 差不多.  You and everyone on your team will
be effected by the Sunk Cost Fallacy:  “Your decisions are tainted by the
emotional investments you accumulate, and the more you invest in something the
harder it becomes to abandon it”. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id6" id="id3">3</a>  If you build beautiful drawings with a
graphic design application; you will need to put time and effort into them and
you will probably become emotionally attached to them.  Remember, they are just
mistakes in the right direction. You need to be able to destroy these pictures
to find a better way.</p>
<p>Create beautiful, slow changing, external documentation.  If you are talking to
investors or senior managers, they will not know how to evaluate your position
based on its technical merits.  Instead, they will assign you prestige based on
emotional cues.  They will not understand what you are talking about, so you
need to address this as a marketing problem; make things look good. Your
audience will use their emotionally subjective experience to evaluate your more
profound work.  Even with this effect taking place, genuinely try to explain
your system in plain language – try not to become a priest, even as you become
a priest in their eyes.  We are working within political environments, so treat
that as part of your engineering problem.</p>
<p>As for where to keep your documents, I vote that you keep them as close as plain
text as possible and in your revision control system.  Add a simple build
process to publish them to an internal web server.  Avoid confluence or any
other technology that wants to put their business between you and your
information.  HTML works just fine.</p>
<p>Videos!  It is easy to make a video; so use them to capture your system
dynamics.  They catch tremendous amounts of information, and they are cheap and
easy to make.</p>
<p>In summary.  Accept that the system will never be adequately described.  Focus
on the economics of describing enough of it so that you can see what is going
on, and you can relate it to another person.  Use free tools, constantly redraw
your statecharts as they get closer to what you want.  Use the working code on
multiple nodes to output instrumentation logs, then use these logs with the
sequence tool to draw sequence diagrams.</p>
